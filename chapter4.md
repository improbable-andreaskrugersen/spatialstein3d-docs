# Chapter 4 - Adding a player entity
## Code branch

https://github.com/improbable-andreaskrugersen/spatialstein3d/tree/chapter4-player-entity

## Goals

Last chapter we created our first connection to a local SpatialOS deployment. Now we can actually start sending data over the network. At the end of this chapter we will have a player entity controlled by the client worker and we will be able to see that entity moving in the SpatialOS Inspector.
